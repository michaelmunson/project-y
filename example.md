imagine this framework in the context of a chef in the kitchen that has been given a specific order. making french toast lets say 

in this world, the chef can clone himself if need be and delegate taks to his clone

so anyway, the chef needs to make french toast, so he will do the following:

1. make clone and delegate "get me all the utensils and cookware i need to make french toast." 
2. make clone and delegate "get me the ingrediants needed to make french toast"
3. he will turn on the stove and set it to required temperature
4. await results of both cookware and ingrediant fetching
5. make clone and delegate "take these blueberryes to create a blueberry syrup" 
6. make clone and delegate "take this cookware, and these ingrediants and make french toast"
7. await blueberry syrup and french toast 
8. pour syrup on french toast
9. return the meal

not included in this example, but with a sufficiently complicated meal, a clone might make clone and delegate ... themselves!
